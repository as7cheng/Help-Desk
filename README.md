Introduction

This assignment involves developing a system to prioritize support tickets for a the help desk of a local business. You will implement a priority queue using the heap data structure, for this purpose. After developing this system, you will need to develop several tests that demonstrate the correctness of your implementation under a variety of specific circumstances. These tests will be used to evaluate the correctness of other implementations, just as other tests will be used to evaluate the correctness of yours.
